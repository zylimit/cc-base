// lib/review.mjs -- S20 the review layer: structured disagreement as a gate, plus the one
// rule the sibling engine had to leave as prose.
//
// Why review is a gate here and not a habit: it is the only lever in this field with a
// measured effect worth building machinery around. An agentic review loop moved one model
// from 27.5% to 56.9% on SWE-bench Verified at 6.5x the token efficiency of resampling, and
// three agents in structured disagreement beat five in consensus. Consensus is the failure
// mode, not the goal -- reviewers agreeing cheaply is not review. So the engine computes the
// verdict from what was actually recorded, and refuses to compute one at all when the review
// did not look: no blue self-report, no report from a convened lens, no verdict.
//
// The rule this file exists to add, and the reason it lives in cc-base rather than being a
// port: the sibling harness marks "the reviewer is never the author" prompt-only and says why
// -- its engine counts lenses and cannot tell who wrote the code. Claude Code's hook events
// carry agent_id and agent_type (SubagentStart / SubagentStop / PostToolUse), so here that
// fact is recordable: `authorship record` appends who touched which files, and `review
// verdict` refuses an ACCEPT carried by a lens the author of those files reported. Where the
// ledger is empty the answer is authorshipEnforced:false with the reason spelled out -- an
// unenforced rule reported as enforced would be worse than the prose version it replaces.
//
// Runtime state lives under .claude/harness/state/, which is already git-ignored, already
// excluded from the diff fingerprint (STATE_EXCLUDE / isStateExcluded in core.mjs) and
// already denied entry to a context pack (DENY in core.mjs). That is deliberate: the review
// session binds the diff it judged, so a session file that perturbed that diff would stale
// itself on every write.
//
// Depends on core / catalog / graph / quality / evidence. Nothing imports this module except
// harness.mjs and selftest, so the graph stays acyclic.
