// lib/spec.mjs -- S19 the specification layer: spec-lint (is the requirement document
// decidable), trace (does anything verify each requirement), spec (a budgeted view of the
// requirements a change actually touches) and dod (run every static governance check once).
//
// What this layer deliberately does NOT do, and why: the obvious move was to port the EARS
// lint from the sibling harness -- require a `REQ-XXX-001` id, a `SHALL`, a `WHEN/WHILE/IF`
// trigger. That grammar belongs to a repository whose requirements are written in it. The
// documents this framework actually produces are prose: product-spec-builder's template
// fixes the shape of a functional requirement as
//     <name>: <what the user does> -> <what the system does> -> <what comes out>
// which is already the trigger/response/outcome of EARS, minus the ceremony. A lint written
// against the other grammar would match nothing here, pass forever, and leave everyone
// believing the specification had been checked. A gate that cannot fail is worse than no
// gate, so this one is written against the shape that exists.
//
// Requirement ids are optional for the same reason and with the opposite consequence.
// Traceability needs a stable anchor; inventing one (line numbers, heading text, a hash of
// the prose) would produce links that break on the next edit and read as coverage. So
// `trace` degrades and says the anchor is missing rather than pretending. Five-minute
// prototypes keep writing prose; a project that wants traceability adds `[REQ-<mod>-<nnn>]`
// in front of each item and the capability turns on.
//
// TODO/TBD count as unfinished requirement text only in marker shape -- bracketed, suffixed
// with a colon, or standing alone as the whole item. In running prose they are subject matter:
// a specification for a to-do application is a thing people write, and a check that fires on
// the product's own topic is a check everyone learns to skip.
//
// Depends on core / catalog / graph. Nothing imports this module except harness.mjs and
// selftest, so the graph stays acyclic. dod runs the other subcommands as child processes
// instead of calling their cmd* functions, because every one of those ends in emit(), which
// exits the process -- and shelling out has the side benefit that dod asserts on the exit
// code contract the hooks consume rather than on some private return value.
