// lib/release.mjs -- S27 release readiness: assemble the evidence for "can this commit
// ship", and never ship it.
//
// THIS COMMAND NEVER PUBLISHES AND NEVER WRITES. It does not tag, does not push, does not
// create a GitHub release, does not touch a single file in the tree. Releasing is a HIGH-tier
// human decision, and a command that can ship on its own gets one accidental invocation and
// is then never run again by anybody. Every subprocess it starts is a read: `git ls-remote`,
// `gh run list`, and `harness.mjs dod`, which itself only reads.
//
// It also replaces nothing that already exists. Three parts of this repository already own a
// piece of releasing and each keeps its job:
//   .claude/hooks/release-gate.sh    the hook: checks the review queue before the skill loads
//   .claude/scripts/make-release.sh  the packer: builds the zip, strips private feedback, scans
//   skills/release-builder           the human workflow
// What was missing between them is the assembly: running the seven judgements that decide
// whether a commit is shippable, once, in one place, and laying them out as a list somebody
// can check rather than a feeling somebody has.
//
// Eight checks, all of them blocking, all of them able to degrade. Degrading is not passing
// and it is not failing: it means the question could not be answered here, it is reported as
// unknown in both channels, and it does not move the exit code. That asymmetry is the whole
// design of the CI check in particular -- see below.
//
//   worktree      uncommitted changes mean what would ship is not what was tested
//   remote        local HEAD vs what origin actually has, asked over the wire
//   dod           every static governance check, by its own exit code
//   manifest      FRAMEWORK-MANIFEST.txt vs what the generator would write right now
//   review-queue  .claude/.needs-review still holding files
//   tier          the fast tier means this batch skipped the review and test gates
//   ci            the CI conclusion for this exact HEAD
//   gate-fresh    a passing gate record bound to this exact working tree
//
// Two of them are here because of specific incidents in this repository.
//
// `remote` asks the network rather than reading `git status`. The ahead/behind counts in
// `git status` come from the remote-tracking ref in .git, which is a cache of the last fetch
// and can be arbitrarily old; this repository has already shipped a decision made on a stale
// one. `git ls-remote` is the only answer that is about the remote rather than about a local
// copy of an old answer.
//
// `ci` exists because CI here was red for over a month while every batch reported "all
// green" locally. Both statements were true: the local runner and the CI runner do not run
// the same thing. So the conclusion is read from CI itself -- and when it cannot be read,
// the output says CI status is UNKNOWN and that unknown is not a pass. Answering "green"
// because the question could not be asked is exactly the failure this check is named after.
//
// The output also carries a trustBoundary block whose four fields are hardcoded false, and
// they are hardcoded rather than computed because nothing in this process can ever make them
// true. This command does not authenticate who produced the artifact, does not establish that
// a CI system rather than somebody's laptop built it, verifies no external signature, and
// authorizes nothing. An absent field reads as "not applicable"; false reads as "asked, and
// no". A green readiness report is precisely the artifact a hurried reader downstream would
// otherwise quote as though it were a release approval, so the boundary travels inside the
// output where it cannot be left behind -- structure rather than a sentence in a README.
//
// Depends on core / catalog and evidence (the ledger gate-fresh reads) / spec (dodStatus, so
// the three states are mapped in one place rather than two) / memory (the tier and
// review-queue state, same semantics the stop gate and `invariants` already use). Nothing
// imports it except harness.mjs and selftest.
//
// Source is ASCII-only like the rest of the runtime.

// S27.5 check 4 -- manifest
// ===========================================================================
// The question is not "does every listed file still hash the same". It is "is this manifest
// what gen-manifest.sh would write right now", because that is the property the installer
// depends on: setup.sh copies the same set with the same exclusion list, and a framework file
// with no manifest row is treated as user-modified and never overwritten on upgrade. A stale
// manifest therefore does not break loudly -- it makes an upgrade quietly skip files.
//
// The enumeration below reproduces gen-manifest.sh's `case` arms in their order, and two of
// that construct's properties are reproduced with them: `*` matches `/` in a shell case
// pattern, and the first matching arm wins. Approximating either would make this check
// disagree with the generator it is auditing, which is worse than not having it.
//
// Line order is deliberately not compared: gen-manifest pipes through `sort` under whatever
// locale the machine has, so byte order is not a property of the content. Sets are compared.
//
// Four hand-synced copies of this one exclusion set exist: gen-manifest.sh (the generator),
// setup.sh copy_claude_tree and setup.ps1 (the two installers), and this one (the auditor).
// None of them share a source, for two different reasons -- an installer has to run standalone
// against a source tree (setup.sh does not even dare depend on jq), and an auditor that reads
// the generator's own table cannot detect the generator drifting. The cost is manual sync, so
// the wording is held by tests: .claude/tests/test-release-manifest.sh makes real files and
// locks this table against gen-manifest.sh behaviourally, and .claude/tests/test-setup.sh
// section (6) compares the arms of all four literally. Junk files that .claude/.gitignore
// excludes (.DS_Store / Thumbs.db / *.swp) belong here too: unexcluded they get registered as
// framework files and installed into other people's projects.
// So does .claude/worktrees/, where Claude Code isolates a sub-agent by checking out a whole
// copy of the repo -- file for file the same names as the framework's own, one .claude/ deeper.

// ===========================================================================
// S27.8 check 8 -- gate-fresh
// ===========================================================================
// Every other check reads a fact about the tree; this one asks whether the tree was ever
// verified at all. Without it, `release` can report seven greens over a working tree no gate
// has ever seen: `dod` covers the static governance checks and says so in its own note, and
// nothing else in the list runs a single project check. "Ready to ship" would then mean "the
// paperwork is in order".
//
// The binding is the diff fingerprint, the same one receipts use. A gate record establishes
// something about the tree it ran against and nothing about any other, so one edit after the
// gate and the record describes a tree that no longer exists.
//
// Two shapes of PASS are refused, because both established nothing. A Fast Mode run where
// every check was skipped aggregates to gate:'PASS' with exit 0 -- inherited semantics, not a
// bug -- so without this one empty Fast Mode run would feed the release gate forever. And a
// run whose scope the caller chose (`gate --changed ...`) carries a real tree fingerprint
// beside a scope somebody picked, which is the same forgery `task complete` refuses for the
// same reason: the signature is genuine, the thing signed is not.
//
// A run that affected no module is accepted. Nothing needed checking, and since `release`
// already blocks on a dirty worktree, that is the honest shape of a gate run at release time
// -- refusing it would leave this check unsatisfiable at exactly the moment it is consulted.
//
// No catalog means there is no gate for the tree to be fresh against: DEGRADED, reported as
// UNKNOWN, and not a blocker. cc-base itself is such a tree, and a check that stopped it from
// releasing would be deleted inside a week.
