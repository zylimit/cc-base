// lib/task.mjs -- S18 the task envelope and the blast-radius budget: the two places where
// "what am I allowed to do here" stops being a paragraph in a prompt and becomes something
// a command can answer.
//
// The envelope is CLAUDE.md's six fields (Goal / Scope / Out of Scope / Existing Pattern /
// Verification / Escalation) plus an id, checked by the engine rather than by whoever
// remembers to check it. A missing field is named, not summarised: "incomplete envelope"
// tells a fresh instance nothing it can act on. Fields that genuinely do not apply are
// written "N/A" -- an explicit nothing, which is a decision, unlike an absent key.
//
// `task complete` is the hard end of it. Every condition must hold before a task may be
// called done, and each one that does not is returned by name in blockers[]. This is the
// machine form of the acceptance rule: a subagent reporting DONE is a claim about itself,
// while a PASS gate bound to this exact diff -- one that chose its own scope, ran the plan
// this change surface resolves to, and executed at least one check -- plus an accepting
// receipt bound to the same diff, an intact chain, evidence that still matches its digests
// and a non-empty plan are claims that can be re-checked by someone else.
// The scope conditions are not decoration: a gate handed its own scope produces a real
// signature over a made-up subject, which is the failure mode this file exists to stop.
//
// `budget` is deliberately the softest thing in the file. Going over is not a violation to
// be punished; it is a signal to split the work or to escalate it on purpose. Wide changes
// are sometimes correct, and a budget that forbids them just teaches people to disable it.
//
// Depends on core / catalog / graph / quality / evidence. Nothing imports this module
// except the CLI and selftest, so the graph stays acyclic.
