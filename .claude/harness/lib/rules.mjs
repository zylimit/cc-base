// lib/rules.mjs -- S22 the constitution audit: which rules point at something that runs,
// and which ones are only being asked nicely.
//
// Two 2026 results make this measurable rather than aesthetic. The first is that a rule set
// is not free even when it is ignored: agent rule files change behaviour in directions
// nobody wrote down, so a clause that enforces nothing is not neutral, it is a distortion
// with no upside. The second is the ceiling -- instruction adherence falls as the number of
// simultaneous instructions rises. Together they say the thing to minimise is not bytes and
// not clauses. It is the clauses that reach no enforcement point AND do not admit it.
//
// So a constitution where every line names a command is healthy at any length, and a short
// one full of exhortation is not. The four classes:
//
//   machine   the line names a token that resolves to something that exists -- a harness
//             subcommand, a hook, a script, a test. Somebody can run it. Quoting it in
//             backticks is one way to name it; opening the clause with it in bold, the way
//             a capability list does, is the other.
//   prompt    the line says so itself: prompt-only, (P), [P], or the Chinese for "on the
//             honour system". An admitted gap is a managed one.
//   phantom   the line quotes a token shaped exactly like an enforcement point that is not
//             there. This is worse than silence: it reads as enforced, so nobody checks,
//             and the check it names will never run. The only class that fails the command.
//   unclassified  everything else. Not an accusation -- a worklist. Each of these either
//             gets wired to something, gets marked prompt-only, or gets deleted.
//
// The audit is deliberately shy about phantom. A token becomes one only when it could not
// be anything else: an explicit `harness.mjs <word>` whose word is not a subcommand, or a
// literal .sh/.ps1/.mjs path under .claude that is not on disk. Globs, placeholders, JSON
// field names, config keys and data files resolve to nothing and stay out of both machine
// and phantom -- a false phantom would send someone to fix a rule that was never broken,
// and a false machine is an automated phantom, which is the failure this file exists to
// name. When in doubt the token contributes nothing and the line lands in unclassified,
// where a human reads it. The bold form is shyer still and can only ever add machine: a
// backtick says "this is a reference" and is judged both ways, while bold says "this word
// matters" and is read for a reference only because the capability lists happen to open
// with one.
//
// The subcommand table is passed in rather than imported: harness.mjs owns it and imports
// this module, so reaching back for it would close a cycle.
//
// Source is ASCII-only like the rest of the runtime; the one Chinese marker this scanner
// matches is written escaped, with its meaning in the comment beside it.

// S24 claude-md-lint: the directory constitution a high-risk module has to carry
// ===========================================================================
//
// Claude Code loads a CLAUDE.md that sits in a subdirectory on demand: open a file under
// that directory and its rules arrive with it. That makes the nested file the one place a
// module's boundaries can be stated where the work happens, without being paid for out of
// the root constitution's budget by every other module. The corollary is what this command
// names: a high-risk module with no such file has its boundaries stated nowhere near the
// edit, and "the agent will remember what this module may not do" is precisely the kind of
// self-discipline this framework exists to turn into a check.
//
// Scope is narrow on purpose. Only the modules the catalog itself calls high (or critical)
// are asked for one -- a rule that demanded a constitution per module would be paid for by
// every low-risk directory in the tree and switched off inside a week. The four sections are
// the four a boundary statement needs to be actionable: what this module is for, what it may
// not reach, what may never be traded away, and how a change to it gets proved. Headings may
// be written in English or in Chinese, because both are in use here and a lint that accepted
// only one would be asking for the wrong repair.
//
// Two judgements are deliberately strict. A heading with nothing under it counts as absent:
// a shell with no body reads as covered while stating nothing, which is the failure this
// repository names everywhere else. And a heading credits one section, the first it matches:
// "Boundaries and Verification" over a paragraph about boundaries would otherwise let one
// body answer for two sections, and a false green here is worse than the split heading the
// finding asks for.
