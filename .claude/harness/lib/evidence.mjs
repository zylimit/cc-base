// lib/evidence.mjs -- S17 the evidence layer: a gate that records what it actually ran, a
// hash-chained ledger that makes those records tamper-evident, and three readers that keep
// the pile honest as it ages (gate-audit / retention / risk).
//
// How this differs from S8 verify, and why verify is left untouched: verify answers "does
// the gate pass right now" and three hook pairs consume its stdout and exit codes, so its
// shape is a contract. `gate` answers the same question through the same verifyPlan() --
// four-state aggregation, waivers, the quality-attribute gate -- and additionally leaves
// behind something that can be re-read later: each executed check's raw output on disk
// with its digest, a digest of the resolved plan, and one append-only ledger line binding
// all of it to a diff. A green with no retrievable output is a claim; this is evidence.
//
// The ledger fails closed on purpose, in both directions. A broken chain means every
// earlier verification is treated as unproven (task complete blocks, risk reports
// LEDGER_BROKEN); a ledger that cannot be read is not an empty one either, so it degrades
// rather than reporting an intact chain over nothing. There is deliberately no "repair the
// ledger" command: the chain IS the evidence, so a repair tool would be a forgery tool.
// A break therefore does not clear by running the gates again -- new records only append
// past it -- and saying otherwise sends people down a road that ends where it started. The
// honest recovery is a decision a person makes: retire the file (which discards every proof
// it held) and rebuild from there, or find out who edited it.
//
// Two things the first cut of this file got wrong, both fixed here and both regression-locked
// in .claude/tests/test-evidence-defects.sh: the append was a read-then-append with no lock,
// so a burst of concurrent gates broke the chain permanently; and the evidence digests were
// written and never read, which makes a digest decoration rather than a control.
//
// Depends on core / catalog / graph / quality. Nothing here imports task.mjs (task.mjs
// imports this one for the state paths and the chain check), so the graph stays acyclic.
