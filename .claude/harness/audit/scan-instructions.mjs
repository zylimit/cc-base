// scan-instructions.mjs -- treat instruction files as UNTRUSTED input.
//
// Why this exists: CLAUDE.md, .claude/rules/*.md, every skills/*/SKILL.md and
// .claude/agents/*.md are loaded into the model's context automatically, before a
// human necessarily opens them. That makes them executable-adjacent input, and an
// active attack surface: leaked API keys and rewritten model base URLs have been
// found inside AI instruction files in the wild, and README/instruction injection
// is a documented technique for hijacking a coding assistant.
// cc-base loads all of the above and, until this script, scanned none of it.
//
// Deliberately standalone: no import of harness.mjs. If the engine breaks, this
// still runs; it is also meant to be callable straight from a git hook or CI.
//
// Usage:
//   node .claude/harness/audit/scan-instructions.mjs [--staged] [--paths a,b] [--json]
//     --staged   read every scanned byte from the index, not from the working tree
//     --paths    explicit comma-separated candidate set; narrows WHICH files are
//                looked at, never WHERE their contents come from
//     --json     machine mode: stdout JSON only, no human lines on stderr
//
// Contract: stdout is always ONE line of JSON; human diagnostics go to stderr.
//   exit 0  everything in scope was scanned and nothing error-severity came out
//   exit 1  at least one error-severity finding
//   exit 2  usage error (unknown flag, --paths without a value, --paths naming a
//           path that is not there)
//   exit 3  degraded: not a git repository, nothing in scope at all, or something
//           in scope could not be scanned (oversized, unreadable, broken
//           allowlist). "Not scanned" is never allowed to read as "clean", so it
//           gets its own exit code.
//
// Every path is anchored to the repository root. `git ls-files` run from a
// subdirectory lists only that subtree, and names it relative to that
// subdirectory -- so `cd .claude && scan-instructions` used to report exit 0
// ok:true on a repository whose CLAUDE.md carried a prompt injection, purely
// because `rules/demo.md` no longer looked like `.claude/rules/demo.md`. Which
// directory the caller happened to be in is not allowed to change the verdict.
//
// Suppression is EXTERNAL, on purpose. The whole premise of this script is that
// the files it reads are untrusted; a line inside one of them that switches off
// the scan of that same file is self-defeating -- an attacker who can write the
// payload can write the mute. Exemptions live in
// .claude/harness/audit/instructions-allowlist.json (relative to the scanned
// repository), each entry bound to {file, line, rule, sha256-of-that-line} plus a
// required {context} hash over the surrounding lines -- an entry that binds only
// this line's bytes is reported, never honoured. In --staged mode the
// allowlist itself is read from the index: an exemption that is not part of the
// commit must not be able to unlock it. Every exemption that fires is printed and
// carried in the JSON: a silent exemption is a blind spot.
//
// Source is ASCII-only, matching harness.mjs and the .ps1 convention, so the file
// survives every cross-platform encoding trap. Node builtins only.
