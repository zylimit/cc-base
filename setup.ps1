#!/usr/bin/env pwsh
# setup.ps1 - install the cc-base framework assets into a target project (Windows / pure PowerShell).
# Usage: pwsh -File setup.ps1 [-Target <dir>] [-Force] [-DryRun] [-WithTests] [-WithHarness]
#      without -Target, defaults to the current directory ".".
#      -DryRun writes nothing and prints the plan (create / update / conflict / skip) instead.
# Key: write target/.claude/settings.json directly (Claude Code only reads that fixed name, not settings-windows.json).
#      Hook commands are no longer rewritten: settings.json ships the exec form ("command":"node" plus
#      "args":["${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/<name>.mjs"]), which spawns node.exe directly with no shell in
#      between, so the very same file works verbatim on Windows / Mac / Linux.
#      The one thing still rewritten here is statusLine: it has no exec form, only a shell command string, and on a
#      pure PowerShell box that string is run by PowerShell - where the Git Bash spelling "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
#      expands to nothing. Hence the $env: spelling.
#      Also cleaned up: hook files and hook commands an older .sh/.ps1 install of this framework left behind.
